# systemCalls

This code was written for Cisc361 IOperating Systems) at the Univeristy of Delaware.  The point of the assignment
  was to practice using system calls to read the contents of a file and write into another existing file, or else create a  
  new one if the second file does not exist in that directory.
  
  To call on the command line, ./mycp (the executable) fileToRead.text fileToWriteOrCreate.txt
